    "\n",
    "**Primary Result**: Narrative-based chain-of-thought reasoning showed modest improvements (16.7% vs 10.0-13.3%) on physics problems, though not statistically significant with n=30.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights**:\n",
    "1. Physics problems in JEEBench are extremely difficult (10-17% accuracy for all methods)\n",
    "2. Narrative methods showed specific benefit on numeric problems (12.5-25% vs 0%)\n",
    "3. All methods completely failed on multiple-correct questions (0%)\n",
    "4. Effect sizes were small but consistent (Cohen's d = 0.15-0.19)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables Created**:\n",
    "- ✓ REPORT.md: Comprehensive 32KB research report\n",
    "- ✓ README.md: Project overview and quick start guide\n",
    "- ✓ planning.md: Detailed experimental design\n",
    "- ✓ Jupyter notebook: Full implementation and results\n",
    "- ✓ JSON results: Raw data for all 4 methods × 30 problems\n",
    "- ✓ Visualization: Performance comparison plot\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resource Usage**:\n",
    "- Time: ~1.75 hours (well under 3-hour limit)\n",
    "- Cost: ~$18 (well under $100 budget)\n",
    "- Sample: 30 physics problems (strategic subset)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps**: See REPORT.md Section 7 for detailed follow-up recommendations including larger sample evaluation, multi-model testing, and narrative technique ablation."
