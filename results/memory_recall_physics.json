We can use the formula for gravitational acceleration to set up an equation involving the ratio of the accelerations and the heights of the satellites.\n\nThe approach that worked was to first write down the formula for the accelerations of the two satellites, then set up a ratio and solve for the unknown height. This approach made sense because the problem involves a ratio of accelerations, and the formula for gravitational acceleration naturally leads to a ratio when you divide one acceleration by the other.\n\nApplying this approach to the current problem, we have:\n\n$g_P = GM/(R+h_P)^2$ and $g_Q = GM/(R+h_Q)^2$.\n\nWe are given that $g_P/g_Q = 36/25$ and $h_P = R/3$. Substituting these into the ratio gives:\n\n$(GM/(R+h_P)^2) / (GM/(R+h_Q)^2) = 36/25$.\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$(R+h_Q)^2 / (R+h_P)^2 = 36/25$.\n\nSubstituting $h_P = R/3$ gives:\n\n$(R+h_Q)^2 / (R+R/3)^2 = 36/25$.\n\nSolving this equation for $h_Q$ gives $h_Q = 5R/6$, so the answer is (D) $5R/6$.",

The key concept to understand here is the half-life of a radioactive substance. The half-life is the time it takes for half of the radioactive atoms in a sample to decay. This means that after one half-life, half of the original radioactive atoms have decayed. After two half-lives, half of the remaining half have decayed, leaving only one quarter of the original atoms, and so on.\n\nThe approach that worked was to use the concept of half-life to calculate the time it would take for the radioactive material to decay to a safe level. In this case, the radiation is 64 times more than the permissible level, which means it needs to decay to 1/64th of its current level to be safe. \n\nThis approach makes sense because the half-life is a constant property of a radioactive substance. It doesn't matter how much of the substance you have, half of it will decay after one half-life. So, if you know the half-life, you can calculate how long it will take for a certain amount of the substance to decay.\n\nApplying this approach to the problem, we need to find out how many half-lives it takes for the radiation to decay to 1/64th of its current level. Since 2^6 = 64, it takes 6 half-lives for the radiation to decay to 1/64th of its current level. Given that the half-life is 18 days, the minimum number of days after which the laboratory can be considered safe for use is 6 * 18 = 108 days. So, the answer is (C) 108.",

The problem was based on the photoelectric effect, which is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics where electrons are emitted from a material when light shines on it.

    "response": "I remember solving a similar problem in my physics class. The problem was about calculating the escape velocity from a planet's gravitational field. The key concept in that problem was the escape velocity formula, which is derived from the conservation of energy principle. The formula is v = sqrt(2GM/r), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and r is the distance from the center of the planet. The escape velocity is the minimum velocity an object needs to escape the gravitational pull of the planet.\n\nIn this problem, we have two gravitational fields: the Earth's and the Sun's. The rocket needs to escape both. The escape velocity from the Earth's field is given, so we need to calculate the escape velocity from the Sun's field. The Sun's mass is 3 x 10^5 times the Earth's mass, and the distance from the Sun is 2.5 x 10^4 times the Earth's radius. We can use these ratios to calculate the escape velocity from the Sun's field.\n\nThe escape velocity from the Sun's field is sqrt(2GM/r) = sqrt(2G * 3 x 10^5 * M_earth / (2.5 x 10^4 * R_earth)) = sqrt(2 * 3/2.5) * v_e = sqrt(2.4) * 11.2 km/s = 16.8 km/s.\n\nThe total escape velocity is the sum of the escape velocities from the Earth's and the Sun's fields, which is 11.2 km/s + 16.8 km/s = 28 km/s. However, this is not one of the options. I must have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet's try again. The escape velocity from the Sun's field is sqrt(2GM/r) = sqrt(2G * 3 x 10^5 * M_earth / (2.5 x 10^4 * R_earth)) = sqrt(2 * 3/2.5) * v_e = sqrt(2.4) * 11.2 km/s = 16.8 km/s. The total escape velocity is the sum of the escape velocities from the Earth's and the Sun's fields, which is 11.2 km/s + 16.8 km/s = 28 km/s. This is still not one of the options.\n\nI realize my mistake. The escape velocities are not additive. The total escape velocity is the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual escape velocities. So the total escape velocity is sqrt((11.2 km/s)^2 + (16.8 km/s)^2) = sqrt(125.44 + 281.6) km/s = sqrt(407.04) km/s = 20.2 km/s. This is still not one of the options.\n\nI realize my second mistake. The rocket is launched away from the Sun, so the Sun's gravitational pull helps the rocket escape. Therefore, the escape velocity from the Sun's field should be subtracted from the escape velocity from the Earth's field. So the total escape velocity is 11.2 km/s - 16.8 km/s = -5.6 km/s. This is a negative number, which doesn't make sense.\n\nI realize my third mistake. The escape velocity from the Sun's field should be added to the escape velocity from the Earth's field, not subtracted. So the total escape velocity is 11.2 km/s + 16.8 km/s = 28 km/s.

The mirror formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u, where v is the image distance, and u is the object distance. \n\nIn the problem I solved, I first used the lens formula to find the focal length of the lens. Then, I used the mirror formula to find the image distance. The approach worked because it allowed me to use the given information to find the unknowns. \n\nApplying this approach to the current problem, we can start by using the lens formula. Given that the image is double the size of the object, the image distance is -60 cm (negative because it is a real image). The object distance is +30 cm. Using the lens formula, we get 1/f = 1/v - 1/u = 1/-60 - 1/30 = -1/20. So, the focal length of the lens is -20 cm. This means option (D) is correct.\n\nNext, we can use the lens-maker's formula to find the refractive index. Since the lens is plano-convex, one radius of curvature is infinity. The formula simplifies to (n-1)(1/R) = 1/f. Substituting the values, we get n = 1 + f/R = 1 - 20/-20 = 2. So, the refractive index of the lens is 2, not 2.5. This means option (A) is incorrect.\n\nThe radius of curvature of the convex surface can be found using the lens-maker's formula. We already found that n = 2 and f = -20 cm. Substituting these values, we get R = f/(n-1) = -20/(2-1) = -20 cm. So, the radius of curvature is not 45 cm, which means option (B) is incorrect.\n\nFinally, the faint image due to reflection is a virtual image because it is formed by a convex mirror (the convex surface of the lens acts as a mirror). The mirror formula gives 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. Substituting the given values, we get 1/-20 = 1/10 + 1/u. Solving for u, we get u = -20 cm. Since u is negative, the image is virtual and erect.

In this case, the metal is not a perfect black body, but we can still use the law as an approximation because the problem states that the emissivity of the metal remains constant.\n\nThe Stefan-Boltzmann law can be written as P = \u03b5\u03c3T^4, where P is the power radiated, \u03b5 is the emissivity, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. In this problem, we are given the power radiated at two different temperatures and asked to find the ratio of the powers. We can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to find this ratio.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin by adding 273.15. This gives us T1 = 487 + 273.15 = 760.15 K and T2 = 2767 + 273.15 = 3040.15 K.\n\nNext, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to find the ratio of the powers at the two temperatures. The ratio is (P2/P1) = (T2/T1)^4. Substituting the temperatures we found, we get (P2/P1) = (3040.15/760.15)^4.\n\nFinally, we can use the fact that the sensor displays log2(P/P0) to find the value displayed by the sensor when the temperature is T2.

This shunt resistance bypasses most of the current that we want to measure, allowing only a small fraction of it to pass through the galvanometer. \n\nThe approach that worked was to first calculate the maximum current that the galvanometer can measure without the shunt resistance. This is done by using the formula for the torque on a current-carrying loop in a magnetic field, which is given by \u03c4 = nBIAsin\u03b8, where n is the number of turns, B is the magnetic field, I is the current, A is the area of the loop, and \u03b8 is the angle. In this case, the maximum torque occurs when the coil rotates by 0.2 rad, so we can set \u03b8 = 0.2 rad.

The key concept here is Gauss's law, which states that the electric flux through any closed surface is equal to the total charge enclosed by that surface divided by the permittivity of free space. \n\nIn the previous problem, I had a uniformly charged disc and I had to find the electric flux through a spherical surface enclosing the disc. I used Gauss's law and integrated the charge density over the entire disc to find the total charge enclosed. \n\nIn this problem, the charge density is not uniform, but the approach is the same. We need to integrate the charge density over the disc to find the total charge enclosed by each spherical surface. \n\nThe total charge enclosed by the large spherical surface is the integral of the charge density over the entire disc, while the total charge enclosed by the smaller spherical surface is the integral of the charge density over the portion of the disc within the smaller sphere. \n\nThe ratio of the fluxes is then just the ratio of the total charges enclosed by the two surfaces. \n\nLet's apply this approach to solve the problem. \n\nThe total charge enclosed by the large spherical surface is \n\n$Q_{0}=\\int_{0}^{R}\\sigma(r)2\\pi r dr=\\int_{0}^{R}\\sigma_{0}\\left(1-\\frac{r}{R}\\right)2\\pi r dr=\\sigma_{0}\\pi R^{2}$.\n\nThe total charge enclosed by the smaller spherical surface is \n\n$Q=\\int_{0}^{R/4}\\sigma(r)2\\pi r dr=\\int_{0}^{R/4}\\sigma_{0}\\left(1-\\frac{r}{R}\\right)2\\pi r dr=\\frac{15}{64}\\sigma_{0}\\pi R^{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the fluxes is \n\n$\\frac{\\phi_{0}}{\\phi}=\\frac{Q_{0}}{Q}=\\frac{\\sigma_{0}\\pi R^{2}}{\\frac{15}{64}\\sigma_{0}\\pi R^{2}}=\\frac{64}{15}$.",

    "response": "I remember solving a similar problem in my physics class. The problem was about finding the extension of a wire under a certain load. The key concept in such problems is the understanding of stress, strain, and Young's modulus. \n\nStress is the force per unit area, strain is the extension per unit length, and Young's modulus is the ratio of stress to strain. The formula that connects these three quantities is: Stress/Strain = Young's modulus. \n\nThe approach that worked was to first calculate the stress on the wire due to the additional load, then use the Young's modulus to find the strain, and finally use the strain to find the extension of the wire. \n\nThis approach makes sense because it directly applies the definition of Young's modulus and the relationship between stress, strain, and extension. \n\nLet's apply this approach to solve the current problem. \n\nFirst, we calculate the stress on the wire due to the additional load. The force due to the additional load is F = m*g = 1.2 kg * 10 m/s^2 = 12 N. The cross-sectional area of the wire is A = \u03c0*(d/2)^2 = 3.2 * (0.5 mm / 2)^2 = 0.2 mm^2 = 0.2 * 10^-6 m^2. So, the stress is \u03c3 = F/A = 12 N / 0.2 * 10^-6 m^2 = 6 * 10^7 N/m^2.\n\nNext, we use the Young's modulus to find the strain. The Young's modulus is Y = \u03c3/\u03b5, so the strain is \u03b5 = \u03c3/Y = 6 * 10^7 N/m^2 / 2 * 10^11 N/m^2 = 0.3 * 10^-4.\n\nFinally, we use the strain to find the extension of the wire. The strain is the extension per unit length, so the extension is \u0394L = \u03b5*L = 0.3 * 10^-4 * 1.0 m = 0.3 * 10^-4 m = 0.03 mm.\n\nNow, we need to find the vernier scale division which coincides with a main scale division. The least count of the vernier scale is the difference between one main scale division and one vernier scale division, which is 1 mm - 0.9 mm = 0.1 mm. So, the extension of 0.03 mm corresponds to 0.03 mm / 0.1 mm = 0.3 vernier scale divisions. \n\nTherefore, the vernier scale division which coincides with a main scale division is 0.3.",
