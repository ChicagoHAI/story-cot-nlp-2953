    "response": "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is asking us to find the height of satellite Q from the Earth's surface. We are given the height of satellite P, the ratio of the accelerations of the two satellites, and the radius of the Earth.\n\nStep 2: Use the formula for gravitational acceleration\nThe acceleration due to gravity for an object at a distance r from the center of the Earth is given by g = GM/r^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth, and r is the distance from the center of the Earth.\n\nStep 3: Express the accelerations of P and Q in terms of their heights\nFor satellite P, r = R + hP = R + R/3 = 4R/3. So, gP = GM/(4R/3)^2 = 9GM/16R^2.\nFor satellite Q, r = R + hQ. So, gQ = GM/(R + hQ)^2.\n\nStep 4: Use the given ratio of accelerations\nWe are given that gP/gQ = 36/25. Substituting the expressions for gP and gQ from step 3, we get (9GM/16R^2) / (GM/(R + hQ)^2) = 36/25.\n\nStep 5: Simplify the equation\nCancelling GM and simplifying, we get (9/16) * (R + hQ)^2 / R^2 = 36/25. Cross-multiplying and simplifying further, we get (R + hQ)^2 = (36/25) * (16/9) * R^2 = (64/25) * R^2.\n\nStep 6: Solve for hQ\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get R + hQ = (8/5) * R. Therefore, hQ = (8/5)R - R = (3/5)R.\n\nSo, the height of satellite Q from the Earth's surface is 3R/5, which corresponds to option (A).",

    "response": "Step 1: Understand the problem. The problem is about radioactive decay, which follows a half-life pattern. The half-life is the time it takes for half of the radioactive material to decay. In this case, the half-life is 18 days.\n\nStep 2: Understand the given information. The radiation level is currently 64 times the safe level. We need to find out how long it will take for the radiation level to decay to the safe level.\n\nStep 3: Use the concept of half-life to solve the problem. Every 18 days, the radiation level will be halved. So, we need to find out how many 18-day periods are needed for the radiation level to go from 64 times the safe level to the safe level.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the number of half-life periods. Since 64 is 2 to the power of 6 (2^6 = 64), it will take 6 half-life periods for the radiation level to decay to the safe level.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total time. Each half-life period is 18 days, so 6 half-life periods will be 6 * 18 = 108 days.\n\nSo, the minimum number of days after which the laboratory can be considered safe for use is 108 days.

    "response": "Step 1: Understand the concept of the photoelectric effect. According to the photoelectric effect, when light of a certain frequency (or wavelength) is shone on a metal surface, it can cause the emission of electrons. The energy of these electrons is related to the frequency of the light by the equation E = hf - \u03a6, where E is the energy of the emitted electron, h is Planck's constant, f is the frequency of the light, and \u03a6 is the work function of the metal (the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the metal).\n\nStep 2: Convert the wavelength of the light to frequency using the equation c = \u03bbf, where c is the speed of light, \u03bb is the wavelength, and f is the frequency. \n\nStep 3: Convert the stopping potential to energy using the equation E = eV, where E is the energy, e is the charge of an electron, and V is the voltage.\n\nStep 4: Substitute the values of E and f into the equation E = hf - \u03a6 and solve for h. Since we are given multiple sets of data, we can do this for each set and then average the results to get a more accurate value for h.\n\nStep 5: Compare the calculated value of h with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nFor \u03bb = 0.3 \u03bcm and V0 = 2.0 V, \nf = c/\u03bb = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (0.3 x 10^-6 m) = 1 x 10^15 Hz\nE = eV = (1.6 x 10^-19 C) x (2.0 V) = 3.2 x 10^-19 J\nSubstituting these values into the equation E = hf - \u03a6 and assuming \u03a6 = 0 (since we don't have information about it), we get h = E/f = (3.2 x 10^-19 J) / (1 x 10^15 Hz) = 3.2 x 10^-34 J s.\n\nSimilarly, for \u03bb = 0.4 \u03bcm and V0 = 1.0 V, we get h = 4.0 x 10^-34 J s, and for \u03bb = 0.5 \u03bcm and V0 = 0.4 V, we get h = 3.2 x 10^-34 J s.\n\nAveraging these values, we get h = (3.2 x 10^-34 J s + 4.0 x 10^-34 J s + 3.2 x 10^-34 J s) / 3 = 3.47 x 10^-34 J s.\n\nHowever, none of the given options match this value. This suggests that we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's check our work.\n\nUpon reviewing our calculations, we realize that we made a mistake in converting the stopping potential to energy. The correct equation is E = eV0, not E = eV. Using this corrected equation, we get:\n\nFor \u03bb = 0.3 \u03bcm and V0 = 2.0 V, E = (1.6 x 10^-19 C) x (2.0 V) = 3.2 x 10^-19 J, and h = E/f = (3.2 x 10^-19 J) / (1 x 10^15 Hz) = 3.2 x 10^-34 J s.\n\nFor \u03bb = 0.4 \u03bcm and V0 = 1.0 V, E = (1.6 x 10^-19 C) x (1.0 V) = 1.6 x 10^-19 J, and h = E/f = (1.6 x 10^-19 J) / (7.5 x 10^14 Hz) = 2.13 x 10^-34 J s.\n\nFor \u03bb = 0.5 \u03bcm and V0 = 0.4 V, E = (1.6 x 10^-19 C) x (0.4 V) = 0.64 x 10^-19 J, and h = E/f = (0.64 x 10^-19 J) / (6 x 10^14 Hz) = 1.07 x 10^-34 J s.\n\nAveraging these values, we get h = (3.2 x 10^-34 J s + 2.13 x 10^-34 J s + 1.07 x 10^-34 J s) / 3 = 2.13 x 10^-34 J s.\n\nThis value is still not matching with any of the given options. This suggests that our assumption that \u03a6 = 0 was incorrect. In reality, the work function of the metal is not zero, and we need to take it into account in our calculations.\n\nUnfortunately, without information about the work function, we cannot accurately calculate Planck's constant from this data. Therefore, the problem cannot be solved with the given information.",

The frequency of the sound heard by an observer (in this case, the pipe) depends on the relative speed of the source and the observer. If the source is moving towards the observer, the frequency heard by the observer is higher than the actual frequency of the sound. The observed frequency (f) is given by f = fs*(v+u)/v, where fs is the source frequency and u is the speed of the source.\n\nStep 3: For resonance to occur, the observed frequency must be equal to the natural frequency of the pipe. Therefore, we need to find the combinations of u and fs for which f = f0.\n\n(A) For u=0.8v and fs=f0, the observed frequency is f = f0*(v+0.8v)/v = 1.8f0, which is not equal to f0.

    "response": "(A) The temperature distribution over the filament is uniform\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The temperature distribution over the filament may not be uniform due to various factors such as the shape and thickness of the filament, the distribution of the electric current, and the rate of evaporation of tungsten from different parts of the filament. Therefore, we cannot assume that the temperature distribution is uniform.\n\n(B) The resistance over small sections of the filament decreases with time\n\nThis statement is true. As the filament evaporates, its cross-sectional area decreases, which increases its resistance according to Ohm's law (R = \u03c1L/A, where R is resistance, \u03c1 is resistivity, L is length, and A is cross-sectional area). However, the question states that the resistance decreases with time, which is the opposite of what we would expect. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n(C) The filament emits more light at higher band of frequencies before it breaks up\n\nThis statement is true. According to Planck's law of black-body radiation, the intensity of radiation emitted by a black body (like the tungsten filament) increases with temperature for a given frequency. As the filament gets hotter, it emits more light at higher frequencies.\n\n(D) The filament consumes less electrical power towards the end of the life of the bulb\n\nThis statement is false. The power consumed by the filament is given by P = IV, where I is the current and V is the voltage. Since the voltage is constant, the power consumption depends on the current. As the resistance of the filament increases due to evaporation, the current decreases according to Ohm's law (I = V/R). Therefore, the power consumption decreases with time. However, the question states that the power consumption decreases towards the end of the life of the bulb, which is the opposite of what we would expect. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) The filament emits more light at higher band of frequencies before it breaks up.",

We are given the reading at one temperature and asked to find the reading at another temperature.\n\nStep 2: Convert the temperatures to Kelvin\nThe temperatures given are in Celsius. We need to convert them to Kelvin because the Stefan-Boltzmann law works with absolute temperatures. The conversion is done by adding 273.15 to the Celsius temperature.

So, the vernier scale division that coincides with a main scale division is 300 / 0.9 = 333.33, which rounds to 333.",

    "question": "A pendulum consists of a bob of mass $m=0.1 \\mathrm{~kg}$ and a massless inextensible string of length $L=1.0 \\mathrm{~m}$. It is suspended from a fixed point at height $H=0.9 \\mathrm{~m}$ above a frictionless horizontal floor. Initially, the bob of the pendulum is lying on the floor at rest vertically below the point of suspension. A horizontal impulse $P=0.2 \\mathrm{~kg}-\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}$ is imparted to the bob at some instant. After the bob slides for some distance, the string becomes taut and the bob lifts off the floor. The magnitude of the angular momentum of the pendulum about the point of suspension just before the bob lifts off is $J \\mathrm{~kg}-\\mathrm{m}^2 / \\mathrm{s}$. The kinetic energy of the pendulum just after the liftoff is $K$ Joules. What is the value of $K$?",
