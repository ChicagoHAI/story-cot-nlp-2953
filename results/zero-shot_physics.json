    "response": "(A) The power radiated by the filament can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. The equation is given by P = \u03c3AT^4, where P is the power, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, A is the surface area, and T is the temperature. \n\nSubstituting the given values, we get P = (5.67 x 10^-8 Wm^-2K^-4) x (64 x 10^-6 m^2) x (2500 K)^4 = 643.5 W. Therefore, the power radiated by the filament is in the range 642 W to 645 W. So, option (A) is correct.\n\n(B) The power entering into one eye of the observer can be calculated by considering the geometry of the situation. The power spreads out over a sphere of radius 100 m, and the eye captures a fraction of this power equal to the ratio of the area of the pupil to the area of the sphere. \n\nThe area of the sphere is 4\u03c0r^2 = 4\u03c0(100 m)^2 and the area of the pupil is \u03c0r^2 = \u03c0(3 x 10^-3 m)^2. Therefore, the power entering the eye is (643.5 W) x (\u03c0(3 x 10^-3 m)^2 / 4\u03c0(100 m)^2) = 3.22 x 10^-8 W. Therefore, the radiated power entering into one eye of the observer is in the range 3.15 x 10^-8 W to 3.25 x 10^-8 W. So, option (B) is correct.\n\n(C) The wavelength corresponding to the maximum intensity of light can be calculated using Wien's displacement law, which states that the wavelength of the peak spectral radiance of black body radiation is inversely proportional to the temperature of the black body. The equation is given by \u03bb_max = b/T, where \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, b is the Wien's displacement constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get \u03bb_max = (2.90 x 10^-3 m-K) / (2500 K) = 1.16 x 10^-6 m = 1160 nm. Therefore, the wavelength corresponding to the maximum intensity of light is 1160 nm. So, option (C) is correct.\n\n(D) The total number of photons entering per second into one eye of the observer can be calculated using the energy of a photon, which is given by E = hc/\u03bb, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and \u03bb is the wavelength. The number of photons is then the power divided by the energy per photon.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get E = (6.63 x 10^-34 Js) x (3.00 x 10^8 ms^-1) / (1740 x 10^-9 m) = 1.14 x 10^-19 J. Therefore, the number of photons is (3.22 x 10^-8 W) / (1.14 x 10^-19 J) = 2.82 x 10^11. Therefore, the total number of photons entering per second into one eye of the observer is in the range 2.75 x 10^11 to 2.85 x 10^11. So, option (D) is correct.",
