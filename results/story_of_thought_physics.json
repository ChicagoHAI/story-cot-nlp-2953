In the case of water in a capillary tube, these forces are the cohesive forces (between water molecules) and adhesive forces (between water and the tube).\n\nStep 2: Apply the formula for capillary rise\n\nThe height to which a liquid rises in a capillary tube is given by the formula:\n\nh = (2\u03c3cos\u03b8)/(\u03c1gr)\n\nwhere:\nh = height of the liquid\n\u03c3 = surface tension of the liquid\n\u03b8 = angle of contact\n\u03c1 = density of the liquid\ng = acceleration due to gravity\nr = radius of the capillary tube\n\nStep 3: Analyze each statement based on the formula\n\n(A) For a given material of the capillary tube, h decreases with increase in r. This is true, as h is inversely proportional to r in the formula.\n\n(B) For a given material of the capillary tube, h is independent of \u03c3. This is false, as h is directly proportional to \u03c3 in the formula.\n\n(C) If this experiment is performed in a lift going up with a constant acceleration, then h decreases. This is true, as the effective gravity in the lift (g + acceleration of lift) is greater than g, making it harder for the water to rise.\n\n(D) h is proportional to contact angle \u03b8. This is false, as h is proportional to cos\u03b8, not \u03b8.\n\nSo, the correct statements are (A) and (C).",

The pressure difference is caused by the relative motion between the plate and the gas molecules. The faster the plate or the gas molecules move, the greater the pressure difference.\n\nStep 2: Analyze statement [B]\nThe resistive force experienced by the plate is proportional to $v$.

In this case, the magnification is 2 (since the image is double the size of the object), the object distance is -30 cm (negative because the object is on the same side of the lens as the light source), and the image distance is unknown.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n2 = -v / -30\nv = 2 * 30 = 60 cm\n\nThe lens formula is given by 1/f = (n-1)[1/R - 1/\u221e], where f is the focal length, n is the refractive index, R is the radius of curvature, and \u221e is the radius of curvature of the flat surface (since the curvature of a flat surface is zero, its radius of curvature is infinity).\n\nWe also have another lens formula 1/f = 1/v - 1/u.

So, statement (B) is not true because the radius of curvature is not 45 cm.\n\nStep 4: Determine the nature of the faint image\n\nSince the faint image is formed by reflection, it is virtual and erect.

Upon reviewing the calculations, we realize that we made an error in the sign of R. The radius of curvature of a convex surface should be positive, so R should be 30 cm, not -30 cm.\n\nCorrecting this error, we find:\n\n1/20 = (n-1)/30\nn-1 = 30/20 = 1.5\nn = 1.5 + 1 = 2.5\n\nSo, statement (A) is true.\n\nIn conclusion, the true statements are (A) and (D).",

    "response": "Step 1: Calculate the force due to the additional load\nThe force (F) due to the additional load is the mass (m) times the acceleration due to gravity (g). Given that m = 1.2 kg and g = 10 m/s^2, we have:\n\nF = m * g = 1.2 kg * 10 m/s^2 = 12 N\n\nStep 2: Calculate the stress on the wire\nThe stress (\u03c3) on the wire is the force (F) divided by the cross-sectional area (A) of the wire. The cross-sectional area of a wire with diameter (d) is given by A = \u03c0 * (d/2)^2. Given that d = 0.5 mm = 0.5 * 10^-3 m and \u03c0 = 3.2, we have:\n\nA = \u03c0 * (d/2)^2 = 3.2 * (0.5 * 10^-3 m / 2)^2 = 0.2 * 10^-6 m^2\n\nThen, \u03c3 = F / A = 12 N / 0.2 * 10^-6 m^2 = 6 * 10^7 N/m^2\n\nStep 3: Calculate the strain on the wire\nThe strain (\u03b5) on the wire is the stress (\u03c3) divided by the Young's modulus (Y). Given that Y = 2 * 10^11 N/m^2, we have:\n\n\u03b5 = \u03c3 / Y = 6 * 10^7 N/m^2 / 2 * 10^11 N/m^2 = 0.3 * 10^-3\n\nStep 4: Calculate the extension of the wire\nThe strain (\u03b5) is also the extension (\u0394L) divided by the original length (L). Given that L = 1.0 m, we have:\n\n\u0394L = \u03b5 * L = 0.3 * 10^-3 * 1.0 m = 0.3 mm\n\nStep 5: Find the vernier scale division that coincides with a main scale division\nThe least count (LC) of the vernier calipers is the difference between one main scale division (MSD) and one vernier scale division (VSD). Given that 10 VSD = 9 MSD, we have:\n\nLC = 1 MSD - 1 VSD = 1 mm - 0.9 mm = 0.1 mm\n\nThen, the number of vernier scale divisions (n) that coincide with a main scale division after the extension is \u0394L / LC = 0.3 mm / 0.1 mm = 3\n\nSo, the 3rd vernier scale division coincides with a main scale division after the load on the steel wire is increased by 1.2 kg.",

    "question": "A pendulum consists of a bob of mass $m=0.1 \\mathrm{~kg}$ and a massless inextensible string of length $L=1.0 \\mathrm{~m}$. It is suspended from a fixed point at height $H=0.9 \\mathrm{~m}$ above a frictionless horizontal floor.

    "response": "Step 1: Calculate the velocity of the bob just before it lifts off\n\nThe impulse imparted to the bob is equal to the change in momentum of the bob. Since the bob was initially at rest, the final momentum of the bob is equal to the impulse. Therefore, the velocity of the bob just before it lifts off can be calculated using the formula:\n\nP = m*v\n\nwhere P is the impulse, m is the mass of the bob, and v is the velocity of the bob.

    "predicted": null,
    "correct": false,
    "response": "Step 1: Understanding the properties of Rydberg states\n\nIn Rydberg states, the electron is very far from the nucleus, so the atom is very large. The radius of an orbital in a hydrogen-like atom is given by the formula $r = n^{2}a_{0}/Z$, where $a_{0}$ is the Bohr radius. \n\nStep 2: Testing hypothesis A\n\nThe relative change in the radii of two consecutive orbitals is given by the difference in their radii divided by the radius of the first orbital. Using the formula for the radius, we find that the relative change is $(r_{n+1} - r_{n})/r_{n} = (n^{2} + 2n + 1 - n^{2})/n^{2} = 2/n + 1/n^{2}$. This does not depend on $Z$, so hypothesis A is true.\n\nStep 3: Testing hypothesis B\n\nThe relative change in the radii of two consecutive orbitals varies as $2/n + 1/n^{2}$, not as $1/n$. So, hypothesis B is false.\n\nStep 4: Understanding the energy of Rydberg states\n\nThe energy of an orbital in a hydrogen-like atom is given by the formula $E = -Z^{2}e^{2}/2a_{0}n^{2}$, where $e$ is the charge of the electron.\n\nStep 5: Testing hypothesis C\n\nThe relative change in the energy of two consecutive orbitals is given by the difference in their energies divided by the energy of the first orbital. Using the formula for the energy, we find that the relative change is $(E_{n+1} - E_{n})/E_{n} = (n^{2} - (n+1)^{2})/n^{2} = -2/n - 1/n^{2}$. This varies as $1/n$, not as $1/n^{3}$. So, hypothesis C is false.\n\nStep 6: Understanding the angular momentum of Rydberg states\n\nThe angular momentum of an orbital in a hydrogen-like atom is given by the formula $L = n\\hbar$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nStep 7: Testing hypothesis D\n\nThe relative change in the angular momenta of two consecutive orbitals is given by the difference in their angular momenta divided by the angular momentum of the first orbital. Using the formula for the angular momentum, we find that the relative change is $(L_{n+1} - L_{n})/L_{n} = (n + 1 - n)/n = 1/n$.
